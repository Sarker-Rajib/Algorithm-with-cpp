Problem Statement

Mina and Rita were playing with their dolls. Both of them had given names to their dolls. Now, they want to create a nameplate to attach to their dog's collar. However, their father told them he can only provide money for one nameplate. So, they need to create a single nameplate that includes both of their doll's names while keeping it as short as possible due to the character limit.

Can you help them choose a name that incorporates both of their doll's names and is as short as possible?

Input Format

First line will contain T, the number of test cases.
Each line of the test case will contain two strings A and B which are the name of the dolls.
Constraints

1 <= T <= 1000
1 <= |A|, |B| <= 1000; Here |A| and |B| means the length of A and B. The string will contain small English alphabets only and won't contain any spaces.
Output Format

Print the number of character in that name which can be printed on the name plate.
Sample Input 0
