/*  Question: You will be given an undirected graph as input.
    This graph will contain only one connected component. The edge number will be exactly node-1.
    Then take a node from the input and print its height. Consider root as 1.

    in:                 out: height of 1 = 2
    7
    6
    1 2
    2 4
    2 5
    1 3
    3 6
    1 7
